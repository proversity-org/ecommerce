Journals Service Ecommerce Integration
=====================================

The Journal Product enables organizations to provide educational
resources that are better surfaced outside of the course experience. For
more information and to see the source code checkout the `journals repo`_:

This module contains the necessary integrations to make the journals
product purchasable. It is also a rough primer on some important basics
of how edx-ecommerce works.

A New Journal Product Class
===========================

Oscar has a concept *product class* (in the Oscar UI it’s referred to as
*product type*). This is just a type of product, like *course seat* or
*course entitlement*.

Creating a New Product Class
----------------------------

New product classes can be made manually through the oscar dashboard: http://localhost:18130/dashboard/catalogue/product-types/

But we want that product type to exist even if we reprovision ecommerce, and to exist on every environment without manual intervention.  So we manually make a migration: `0032_journal_product_class`_ 

-  This migration writes a new row to the ``catalogue_productclass`` table, creating the product class ``Journal``
-  It also writes a row to the ``catalogue_productattribute`` table, which specifies that the product class ``Journal`` has an attribute ``UUID``

Important tables that define a product in oscar:

-  ``catalogue_productclass``: defines types of products
-  ``catalogue_productattribute``: defines a set of attributes for a given product type

   -  *For example*: the ``Journal`` product class has one product attribute associated with it, that is ``UUID``. Other products may have no or multiple attributes.
   -  Again, this could be done through the oscar UI, but we do this through migrations to make sure that it persists through provisions: http://localhost:18130/dashboard/catalogue/product-type/6/update/#product_attributes

-  ``catalogue_product``: describes an instance of a product

   -  *For example*: You may have the product class ``course seat``, but an instance of that product may be ``seat in course DemoX``
   -  You can create a new product through the dashboard: http://localhost:18130/dashboard/catalogue/
   -  We do not create journals through the oscar dashboard, see `Creating a new instance of a Journal Product`_ below
   -  `catalogue_productattributevalue`: describes attributes of specific instances of products

Fulfillment (buying and refunding)
----------------------------------

Great now the product class exists and you can make new products but how
do you buy and refund that product?

Adding a Product to the Basket Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All products are purchased through the basket page and any product or set of products can be added to the basket page like so:

-  To add single product to basket page go to this url: http://localhost:18130/basket/add/?sku=\ <PRODUCT_SKU>

   -  *For example*: http://localhost:18130/basket/add/?sku=E2ADB40
   -  *For context*: the course about page’s purchase button links to the basket page with that course’s sku filled in

-  To add multiple products to basket page go to this url: http://localhost:18130/basket/add/?sku=<PRODUCT_1_SKU>&sku=<PRODUCT_2_SKU>
      
   -  *For example*: http://localhost:18130/basket/add/?sku=E2ADB40&sku=9BCCF4A
   -  *For context*: on the program about page, the purchase button links to the basket page with all of the course skus for that program in filled in

Fulfillment
~~~~~~~~~~~
How does oscar/ecommerce know how to fulfill a journal properly?

-  Register the journal fulfillment modules in the `oscar settings`_

   -  Add ``JournalFulfillmentModule`` to ``FulfillmentModules``

-  Each item in the basket is considered a ``line`` item.  Line items are supported by different fulfilment modules.  If a user is purchasing a line item supported by the journal fulfillment module the ``fulfill_product`` method will be called:  `journal fulfillment module`_

   -  Specifically for journals we make a POST request to the journal service ``journalaccess`` api.

      - The ``journal access`` api takes a user name and a journal id and grants access for that user to that journal.  For more info checkout the `journals repo`_
      -  We call that api in the ``post_journal_access`` method in `journal client`_

Refunds
~~~~~~~

-  There are two ways a refund is initiated generally

   -  The user initiates a refund through their dashboard

      -  This functionality does not exist for journals yet, it does exist for course seats and entitlements
      -  There are policy rules around this for course seats and entitlements, not for journals yet. The policy controls things like how long since purchase can you request a refund.

   -  A refund is requested through the oscar dashboard.  

      - From the user's perspective they will contact support and support will initiate the request through the oscar UI.
      - To make a refund for a specific order: http://localhost:18130/dashboard/orders/
      - When you click ``Approve Credit and Revoke`` the refund is initiated

-  What happens when a refund is initiated?

   -  Very similar to fulfillment, but instead the method ``revoke_line`` is called in the `journal fulfillment module`_
   -  For journals, when ``revoke_line`` is called we make a POST request to the ``journalaccess`` api but ``revoke_access`` to ``true``
   -  We call that api in the ``revoke_journal_access`` in `journal client`_


Journal Bundle Offers
=====================

**Journal Bundles** are a way to associate specific journals and specific
courses so that discounts can be applied when users buy them together.

**Offers** are an oscar concept, they allow you to create discounts in the
checkout basket if certain conditions are met.

Actually creating a journal bundle is done through the discovery django
admin, but creating a discount associated with that journal bundle is
done through the journal bundle offer page hosted in ecommerce.


How to create new journal bundle offers
---------------------------------------

-  First, you must have created a journal bundle in the discovery admin:

   -  Go to: http://localhost:18381/admin/journal/journalbundle/
   -  Click: ``ADD JOURNAL BUNDLE +``
   -  Fill in appropriate fields for your journal bundle
   -  Click: ``SAVE``

-  Create journal bundle offer

   -  Go to Journal Offers Dashboard: http://localhost:18130/journal/offers/
   -  Click: ``Create Journal Bundle Offer``
   -  Fill in the fields

      -  *Note*: ``Journal Bundle UUID`` can be found in the discovery django admin:  http://localhost:18381/admin/journal/journalbundle/

How do Offers Work?
-------------------

Just like products, offers can be created through the oscar dashboard (http://localhost:18130/dashboard/offers/), but we have created a different UI for our offers. All edx offers work pretty similarly:

-  The UI is made up of two templates that are basically copied between program, enterprise and journal offers

   -  Page listing all of the current journal offers: `journalbundleoffer_list`_
   -  Form where you can create new journal offers: `journalbundleoffer_form`_
    
-  The views controling these UIs can be found here: `journal views`_

   -  This calls the discovery api which fetches and caches the journal bundles: see ``fetch_journal_bundles`` in `journal client`_

-  Important tables related to offers:

   -  ``offer_conditionaloffer``: an instance of a conditional offer
   -  ``offer_condition``: the condition that must be met for an offer
   -  ``offer_benefit``: the benefit that will be applied to a given offer

Creating a new instance of a Journal Product
============================================

Because ecommerce and discovery need to have knowledge of journal
products, we have a management command to run that will update each
service.

These steps assume you have already provisioned journals on your local machine. If you have not, follow these steps: https://github.com/edx/journals

-  Change the ecommerce domain name to ``edx.devstack.ecommerce:18130``: http://localhost:18130/admin/sites/site/

   -  This is obviously not ideal currently there is a ticket on the backlog tracking this issue

-  In journals directory run: ``make app-shell``
-  To create a journal run: ``python manage.py publish_journals --create "<journal title>" --org "<partner org>" --price "<price>"``

   -  *For example*: ``python manage.py publish_journals --create "One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi" --org "edX" --price "42.00"``

-  Change the ecommerce domain name back to to ``localhost:18130``: http://localhost:18130/admin/sites/site/

That management command, ``publish_journals``, creates a journal in the journal service and creates an instance of a journal product in ecommerce. It does this by using this API that we made: http://localhost:18130/journal/api/v1/journals/


Future work
===========

Must happen before MVP release of Journals (All have been captured in jira tickets):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Journal fulfillment should be async, just like seat fulfillments are today
-  Make sure that journals is not over using atomic transactions in its fulfillment or refund
-  Set up error monitoring for journal fulfilment

V2 release of Journals - It is a requirement that these issues are dealt with if journals remains in the code (All captured in jira tickets):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  User initiated refunds: Currently refunds can only be initiated via the oscar dashboard. Practically, this means that a user can only get a refund by contacting support. Support then has to request the refund through the oscar dashboard. Remaining work for refunds includes:

   -  Creating a UI for users to request their own refunds
   -  Create a policy the controls when a user can and cannot request a refund

-  Fix bug where you have to change your ecommerce site host name in order to run the ``publish_journals`` management command
- The offers admin pages do not handle pagination well - make sure if there are many journal bundle offers we handle that case. The UI should show paginated results and we should make sure we are only makeing the calls we need to discovery.


Suggested Improvements to the Ecommerce that are not specifically related to Journals:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Creating a product requires a bunch of boilerplate code, and it is not ideal that we need to have to use migrations for this. Ideally, we would have a config file with the list of products we want to install and new products like Journals would be plug-inable. Discovery work is required to determine what a good approach for this would be. 

   - We tried to keep most of the journal code in the ``journals`` app.  All of the places where the journals code leaked into the main code have been documented with this comment: ``# TODO: journal dependency``

-  The journal offer templates are all basically copied from program and enterprise offers - which is obviously not ideal we should probably have a way for this to be more generic for any type of offer.
-  There should be a generic idea of bundling.
-  The way offers works is that every time a basket page loads it goes through every conditional offer in the ``offer_conditionaloffer`` table and checks if the conditions of said offer are met. This can be a huge performance hit especially as the number of program, enterprise and journal offers grow
